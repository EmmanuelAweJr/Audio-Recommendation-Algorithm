An unsupervised learning pipeline 

I'm a data science fellow participating in a year long fellowship designed to give me a bedrock of skills to enter the data analytics/engineering tech space. I've gone over the basics of machine learning, programming, statistics, and database management and now the staff has decided to task me with completing a fundamental project that every data scientist should participate in. A recommendation algorithm.

For this project I will create an unsupervised learning pipeline.

1. Initial EDA
2. Data Preprocessing & Dimensionality Reduction
3. Unsupervised Modeling & tuning
4. Report
